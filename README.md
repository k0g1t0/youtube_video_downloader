# YouTube Video Downloader

This Python script allows you to download YouTube videos and merge them with audio tracks using the `pytubefix` and `moviepy` libraries.  
The script downloads the highest resolution video and the highest bitrate audio available for a given YouTube URL, combines them, and saves the final video file.

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- [`pytubefix`](https://pypi.org/project/pytubefix/)
- [`moviepy`](https://pypi.org/project/moviepy/)
- `os`
- `re`

If you don't have them, you can easily install the required libraries using pip and the `requirements.txt` file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Overview

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - `sanitize_filename(filename: str) -> str`: this function takes a filename as input and performs the following:
     - removes the unwanted characters from the given filename using `re`
     - outputs the new filename without the unwanted characters
   - `download_stream(stream: object, output_path='./') -> str`: this function takes a stream object as input and returns the file name if successful otherwise it returns `None`
    
   - `download_and_merge(url: str)`: this function takes a YouTube video URL as input and performs the following:
     - creates a `YouTube` object with the provided URL and sets a progress callback.
     - checks if the file alredy exists
     - filters and selects the highest resolution video stream and the highest bitrate audio stream.
     - downloads the selected video and audio streams to the current directory.
     - renames the downloaded files to temporary names for processing.
     - loads the video and audio clips using `moviepy`.
     - combines the audio with the video clip.
     - writes the final merged video file to the current directory with the title of the YouTube video.
     - cleans up by removing the temporary files.

3. **Main Execution Block**:
   - prompts the user to input a YouTube video URL.
   - calls the `download_and_merge` function with the provided URL.

## How To Use

This program is quite simply to use, all you have to do is just launch the `main.py` file.
To do so you can simply type:

```
python3 main.py
```
The `main.py` will use `logic.py` as base to do all of the operations and calculus for downloading the videos.
